# TonyTools
A repo of scripts I'm building for Blender.

-Install addon and enable TonyTools.
-Use T to open side panel and find TonyTools tab


-RenderBool
  Use that on booleans objects to disable their visibility in Cycles. Will also set the shading to wire to improve result in viewport.
  
-SoloLight
 Select a light to isolate it from all other sources of lights. Good to tweak each light contribution to the scene.

-EzSmooth
  Select a light to isolate it from all other sources of lights. Good to tweak each light contribution to the scene.

I'm gradually integrating them into a Tony Tools package with all the scripts.

Use them however you want.

Peace out.
